## Papers

##### Learning without forgetting, Zhizhong Li, Derek Hoiem (2016)
- http://zli115.web.engr.illinois.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/0479.pdf

Describes different strategies for transfer learning: fine-tuning, feature extraction, joint training, and the paper's new strategy: "learning without forgetting". This tries to solve the problem of "continually adding new prediction tasks based on adapting shared parameters without access to training data for previously learned tasks"
